# Multi-label Movie Genre Classification

In this project, we performed multi-label movie genre classification on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data) using the Scikit-learn multi-output classifier. Our EDA can be seen in the `IMDB_EDA.ipynb` notebook, and our models and results can be found in the `IMDB_Modeling.ipynb` notebook.
